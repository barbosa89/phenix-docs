# Introduction

I have a dream, I want to see high performance applications written in PHP, highly scalable and fast; and now that we have fibers in the PHP core, I feel it is the right time for this dream to become a reality.

Phenix is a web framework built on pure PHP, without external extensions, based on the [Amphp](https://amphp.org/) ecosystem, which provides non-blocking operations, asynchronism and parallel code execution natively. It runs in the PHP SAPI CLI and on its own server, it is simply powerful.

Phenix does not try to compete with other frameworks like Laravel, Laravel is powerful and with a different approach, on the contrary, Phenix is inspired by the simplicity and elegance of Laravel, the philosophy of a beautiful syntax is maintained.

The goal of Phenix is to be a tool for the development of modern and high concurrency web applications.
